# github_inspector

App name: Github Inspect.
Stack: Bootstrap & Javascript .

I developed this tiny web app using Github API and it allows you to find github profile and shows user's basic informations along with user's repository, and followers list.
In order to achieve that, you just need to enter the github username, and that's it !
Thank you.
